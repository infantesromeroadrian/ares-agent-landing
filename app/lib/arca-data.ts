  date: "2026-04-30",
  related: "ADR-006, ADR-008, ADR-007 (Superseded)",
  context: "ARCA's hook stack accumulated 4 LLM-as-judge instances assuming a single backend (local Ollama Qwen 2.5 7B). After two weeks running in parallel, two failure modes emerged: (1) Qwen 7B confuses surface-token overlap with comprehension on the diff judge, and (2) using Qwen uniformly contradicts ARCA's own model-tiering philosophy (Opus for high-stakes/low-frequency, Haiku for routing). Note: Forced Justification judge (one of the four) was removed entirely on 2026-05-03 — three judges remain (diff comprehension, ADR completeness, engram nudge).",
  decision: "Adopt a hybrid posture. Migrate adr-judge.sh and diff-judge-opus.sh to Opus 4.7 via Claude Code SDK CLI (~12s per call, low-frequency manual/PR-merge paths). Keep llm-judge.sh and engram-nudge-judge.sh on Ollama Qwen 2.5 7B (~2s, hot-path forced-justification + weekly cron classifier).",
  rationale: [
    "Hot-path latency non-negotiable: forced-justification fires on ~30% of Edits; 12s would push session friction past disable-it-out-of-frustration threshold.",
    "High-stakes judges benefit from Opus reasoning: ADR completeness and diff comprehension are tasks where false APPROVED costs more than slowness.",
    "Plan MAX flat-rate eliminates billing pressure (180 EUR/mo covers SDK calls). Decision is purely latency vs quality.",
    "Fork over refactor minimizes blast radius: existing tests continue, rollback is one symlink swap, parent hook's preference logic is 3 lines of bash.",
  ],
  alternatives: [
    "All four judges on Opus 4.7 — Rejected: hot-path latency unacceptable.",
    "Keep all four on Ollama Qwen — Rejected: Qwen measurably worse on Comprehension Gate v2 tricks; false APPROVED on merge or ADR is high-cost.",
